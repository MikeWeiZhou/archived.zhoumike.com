A simulation of the food-chain. Starring omnivores, carnivores, herbivores, plants, water, and land. Once the balance of prey-vs-predator is out-of-whack, the end is near.

The original idea was to just have fun developing. Eventually, the idea to experiment with the tipping-point of the food-chain became the goal.

There are two maps: Giant Mess and Chain Reaction.

Giant Mess is a delicately balanced map with the right initial life form ratios, birth rates, death rates, and a whole bunch of other rates.

Chain Reaction is the beginning of the end. Sometimes the animals die off. Sometimes the plants die off, which is also a death sentence for the animals, since they die from starvation.
